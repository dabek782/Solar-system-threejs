# Solar-system-threejs
Its my first my first project on github. I used three js html and css for simulation of solar system. All distances between planets and their rotation speed around sun and around thier y axis where scaled down to mimic actual solar system
To start create vite project using npm create vite@latest
After that in terminal write git clone and link of my repository
Than when you open folder with all the files write command npm run dev to open solar system in your browser
